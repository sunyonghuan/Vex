- Added save confirmation before creating, opening, switching files, reopening with another encoding, deleting, or exiting when the current document has unsaved changes.
- Improved the save-confirmation overlay with Save, Don't Save, and Cancel paths so risky actions no longer discard edits immediately.

- Improved find and replace opening so the search input is focused and selected automatically.

### Changed

- Switched the solution file to `.slnx`.
- Moved CodeWF dependencies to NuGet package references.
- Switched UI theming to Semi.Avalonia and Ursa.Semi while keeping the open Avalonia.Themes.Fluent package for AvaloniaEdit.
- Removed CommunityToolkit.Mvvm, moved the shell ViewModel to ReactiveUI, and bound menu actions directly to public methods.
- Registered CodeWF.EventBus through DryIoc and handled editor actions/navigation with `[EventHandler]` methods.
- Added Windows AOT/Win7 and Linux/macOS self-contained single-file publish settings.
- Extracted shared publish profile settings into `FolderProfile.Common.props`, unified outputs under root `publish\<RuntimeIdentifier>\`, and enabled trimming for non-Windows self-contained single-file publishes.
- Removed the NU1904 warning from old `System.Drawing.Common` resolution through central transitive pinning.
- Pinned the transitive `Avalonia.Markup.Xaml.Loader` dependency to Avalonia 12.0.3 to avoid publishing an older runtime loader.
- Improved the properties action to show document state, encoding, size, and path details.
- Restored the startup status bar text to Ready and added empty states for the files and outline sidebar tabs.
- Updated the view menu so outline/files reveal the sidebar, while source mode temporarily hides the sidebar and preview and restores them when toggled off.
- Tested `Vex.slnx` build, dependency vulnerability scanning, desktop smoke startup, and the `win-x64` Release Native AOT plus `linux-x64` self-contained single-file publish paths.
- Tested `publish_vex_all.bat` and confirmed all five Vex publish profiles complete successfully.
- Tested `Vex.slnx` build for the find/replace changes and captured a desktop screenshot for the base window layout.
